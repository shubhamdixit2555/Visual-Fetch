# Visual Fetch

## Project Overview

**Visual Fetch** is an image-searching web application that uses the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) to fetch and display high-quality images. Users can search for a variety of images based on keywords, and the results are presented in a clean, responsive interface. This project demonstrates how to work with third-party APIs and build a dynamic front-end interface.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo here: [Visual Fetch Live](https://visualfetch.netlify.app/)

> **Note**: API calls are limited by the Unsplash free tier, so results may be subject to rate limits.

## Features

- Search for images by keywords using the Unsplash API
- Responsive grid layout to display fetched images
- Clickable images that open full-resolution versions in a new tab
- Smooth and intuitive user interface
- Infinite scrolling for a seamless browsing experience

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For responsive layout and visual design.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: To handle API calls and dynamic rendering of search results.
- **Unsplash API**: To fetch and display images from Unsplash.
- **Netlify**: For deployment of the live demo.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shubhamdixit2555/Visual-Fetch.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Visual-Fetch
   ```

3. **Install dependencies** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Get an Unsplash API key** by signing up at [Unsplash Developer](https://unsplash.com/developers).

5. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root and add your API key:
   ```bash
   REACT_APP_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key_here
   ```

6. **Run the app** (if using a local server like React):
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

7. **Open `index.html`** in your browser (for static projects).

## How It Works

1. The user enters a search term.
2. The app sends a request to the **Unsplash API** with the search term.
3. The Unsplash API responds with a set of images.
4. The images are displayed in a responsive grid layout.
5. Infinite scrolling loads more images as the user scrolls down the page.

## API Reference

This project uses the Unsplash API. Here’s an example of a simple API request to fetch images based on a keyword:

```javascript
const query = 'nature';
fetch(`https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?query=${query}&client_id=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY`)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```
